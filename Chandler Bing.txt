Hi Chandler Bing,

Thank you for contacting Adobe Customer Support Desk. This is Bhargav, I am going to help you with the issue you have contacted us about. To my understanding, the bills are not reaching you and have been charged $30 for paying the fees late. I do understand how you feel, for being charged extra. Do not worry, I can help you by resolving this issue. We do not want to you to have an experience like that. I understand you are upset and I want to help you.  I would be more than happy to help you with that.  You have reached the right department and we would resolve this by today.

 The billing address shown in our data is at Tulsa. I will update it to Apt 20, The Village, Manhattan, New York. I am sorry that your address has not been updated to the present one. I will assure you that, this will not be repeated again. This would in return help you avoid late payment and extra charges. You could also opt for e-bills, to get this you need to login our site www.adobebills.com and enroll your identification number. This would keep you updated on your bill.

To summarize, your bills were sent to wrong address and have been charged $30 for late payment. I have updated your billing address to Apt 20, The Village, Manhattan, New York. Is there anything else I can help you with. Please do reach out to us for further queries, we would be more than glad to help you. You also might want to take a look at support.adobe.com/help, and manage your account, look at new updates and offers online. Once again, thank you for being the best part of Adobe. Have a good day ahead.

Thank you,
