Hi Timothy Burton,
   
      This mail is regarding the reinstallation service to your new location. I can help you by scheduling the the installation service on Sunday. As per your request
     you will be guided by an expert, informing all the procedures to carry the process. 
 
      The technician will visit the address Apt 19, 15th Olive Avenue, Tulsa, Oklahoma on Sunday before 2 P.M. He will guide you with the process involved for the installation and clarify the 
     doubts helping you install it. The reinstallation charge would cost 85 dollars, sine it is reinstallation  for a different location. Can I schedule the installation service on Sunday 2 P.M? Is it fine with you. 

      Thankyou for communicating with us. As per your request an expert technician will be available to help you with the instillation process. Is there anything else that I can help you with. For 
     further queries do contact us at qwert.com and also call us at 111-000-456.

  
 Thankyou, 
 Bhargav
