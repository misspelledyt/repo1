Hi Cameron Stinson,
   Thankyou for communicating with us regarding our services. And I am sorry that your dog is sick, I do understand your situation, you need not worry.However, I can help you by resheduling it.
   
   There would be no change in the address updated that is in Queens. The technician is not available day after tomorrow, maybe I can schedule it on Friday at 11 A.M. Is it fine for you,
  and there would be no charges involved for the installation services. So if this is fine with you, can I reschedule it on Friday 11 A.M.
    
   As I have rescheduled the installation on Friday 11 A.M, is there anything else that I can help you with. For further queries you can log on to www.qwert.com and also contacting the service number
  provided. 
 
                                                                                 

                                                                                                           Thankyou, 
                                                                                                           Bhargav
